# diablo-3

Game server for **Diablo III** on Nintendo Switch, for [Nextendo Network](https://nextendo.network), with **Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled** support contributed by [CollectingW](https://github.com/CollectingW) (see [Crash Team Racing](#crash-team-racing)). Source only — no binaries, no certs, no game assets. Not affiliated with Blizzard, Activision, Demonware or Nintendo.

Diablo III does not use NEX: its online layer is **Demonware**. This server speaks it end to end (auth, the encrypted lobby, remote tasks, matchmaking, NAT discovery) and plugs into the Nextendo stack like the other game servers: a route in sni-router, the account gates and presence of nextendo-account, and `/api/stats` for nextendo-dashboard.

## What works

- Login and "connected to the Diablo network".
- Season and community events served from `pubfiles.json` ([PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md)), with optional monthly season rotation and weekly Challenge Rifts (see [Optional features](#optional-features)).
- Public games: create, find, join, player counts, NAT introductions.
- Co-op between a Switch and an emulator. Tested: game builds 2.7.6 (CFW Switch) and 2.7.7 (Citron), both with season 37, working against this server and against each other.
- Friend lookups inside the game and friend status, with presence reported to nextendo-account. Lightly tested: see [Known limits](#known-limits).
- Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled (Demonware title 5775): login, contextual matchmaking, async matchmaking, friend sessions and rich presence, all written by CollectingW. Not tested on a running game by us: see [Crash Team Racing](#crash-team-racing).

## Requirements

This server runs behind the rest of the Nextendo stack. Two of the pieces need changes that are shipped as separate pull requests.

| component | needed? | what it must provide |
|---|---|---|
| **sni-router** | required | A route sending `crimson-switch-auth3.*.demonware.net` to `BACKEND_D3` (default `127.0.0.1:8460`), with the PROXY protocol v1 header (`SNI_PROXY_PROTOCOL=1` on the router, `NEXTENDO_PROXY_PROTOCOL=1` here) so the auth sees the player's real address. Neither is in sni-router's `main` yet. The lobby (3074) does not go through the router. |
| **nextendo-account** | for account gates and presence | `POST /internal/online-check` and `POST /internal/presence-batch`, authenticated with `X-Internal-Key`. Already in `main`. With `NEXTENDO_REQUIRE_ACCOUNT=0`, an unreachable account service is only logged. |
| **nextendo-dashboard** | optional | A `d3` source polling `/api/stats` on port 8093 (`DASH_D3_URL`, `DASH_D3_TOKEN`). Without it the server works but is not on the shared dashboard. |
| **DNS** | required | `crimson-switch-auth3.*.demonware.net`, `crimson-switch-lobby.*.demonware.net` and `stun.{us,eu,jp,au}.demonware.net` must resolve to the stack; the game must never reach the real Demonware. A console uses Atmosphere hosts entries, an emulator the resolver of its host: exact lines in [Hosts entries](#hosts-entries). |
| **TLS certificate** | required | A certificate and key for the three `crimson-switch-auth3.*.demonware.net` names, from a CA your clients trust (`CERT_FILE`, `KEY_FILE`). Yours to provide; none is shipped and none is committed. |
| **Game update on the client** | required | The client must run the current game update, or it finds updated games but can never join them. The client may also have to match the season being served: builds 2.7.6 and 2.7.7 were tested working with season 37, with this server and with each other. Later seasons have not been tested against those builds. |

## Hosts entries

Diablo III must reach these names on your stack and never on the real Demonware. The auth names go to the machine running sni-router; the lobby and STUN names go straight to the diablo-3 server (the lobby does not pass through the router), which is the address you set as `NEXTENDO_HOST`. They can be the same machine.

```
<ROUTER_IP> crimson-switch-auth3.prod.demonware.net
<ROUTER_IP> crimson-switch-auth3.cert.demonware.net
<ROUTER_IP> crimson-switch-auth3.dev.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     crimson-switch-lobby.prod.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     crimson-switch-lobby.cert.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     crimson-switch-lobby.dev.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     stun.us.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     stun.eu.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     stun.jp.demonware.net
<D3_IP>     stun.au.demonware.net
```

- **Switch (Atmosphere):** add the lines to the end of both `/atmosphere/hosts/emummc.txt` and `/atmosphere/hosts/sysmmc.txt` (the last matching line wins), make sure `enable_dns_mitm = u8!0x1` is set under `[atmosphere]` in `/atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini`, and reboot the console.
- **Emulator:** the same lines in the hosts file of the machine whose resolver the emulator uses, or in the emulator's own redirect if it has one.
- Without the STUN lines the console sends its NAT probes to Activision, and online games stay local only.

## Install

These steps follow the generic [deployment guide](https://github.com/NextendoNetwork/nextendo-docs/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT.md); every value is a placeholder for your own.

1. **Prerequisites.** Go 1.23 or newer, and a running nextendo-account and sni-router.
2. **Build.**

       git clone https://github.com/NextendoNetwork/diablo-3.git
       cd diablo-3
       go build -o server .

   The standard library only. `go test ./...` runs the tests.
3. **Configure.** `cp example.env .env` and edit it; every variable is documented in that file. At minimum:
   - `NEXTENDO_HOST`: the IPv4 address players reach this server on;
   - `NEXTENDO_ACCOUNT_URL`: your nextendo-account;
   - `NEXTENDO_INTERNAL_KEY` and `NEXTENDO_SECRET`: the **same values** nextendo-account uses, or the gates and presence calls are refused;
   - `NEXTENDO_PROXY_PROTOCOL=1`, since sni-router sends the PROXY header;
   - `NEXTENDO_REQUIRE_ACCOUNT=1` once your accounts are live (`0` only logs);
   - `DASH_TOKEN`: a random value.
4. **Certificate.** Point `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` at the certificate your deployment uses for its game servers. sni-router passes the TLS through untouched, so this is the certificate the client sees. It must cover `crimson-switch-auth3.prod.demonware.net`, `.cert.` and `.dev.`, and come from the CA your clients already trust.
5. **sni-router.** Set `BACKEND_D3=127.0.0.1:8460` (or wherever the auth port is) and `SNI_PROXY_PROTOCOL=1`, then restart it.
6. **DNS and firewall.** Add the [hosts entries](#hosts-entries), and open the ports below on the host firewall before the first run: a dismissed firewall prompt leaves a silent block rule.
7. **Dashboard (optional).** On nextendo-dashboard set `DASH_D3_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8093` and `DASH_D3_TOKEN` to your `DASH_TOKEN`.
8. **Run and check.**

       ./server

   The log shows `[D3 Auth] listening HTTPS`, `[D3 Lobby] listening TCP` and `[D3 NAT] listening UDP`. `curl http://127.0.0.1:8093/healthz` returns 200, and a game logging in logs `[D3 Auth] ... -> 200 code=700`.

| port | what |
|---|---|
| 8460 TCP (TLS) | Demonware auth, behind sni-router |
| 3074 TCP | lobby (`LOBBY_PORTS` also opens 3075 to 3080) |
| 3074 UDP | NAT discovery and introductions |
| 8093 HTTP | `/api/stats?key=DASH_TOKEN`, `/api/leaderboards[/<board>]?key=…` (Blizzard-API shape), `/healthz`, `/pubfiles/` |

## Publisher files

The season, the community events with their multipliers, and the item blacklist come from `pubfiles.json`. Every setting is explained in [PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md) and the season themes in [SEASONS.md](SEASONS.md).

    server pubfiles    # regenerate Config.txt / Seasons.txt / Blacklist.txt and exit

The lobby reads them on every request, so a change needs no restart; players see it the next time they connect.

## Crash Team Racing

Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled (Demonware title 5775) speaks the same lobby protocol as Diablo III, so its support lives in this server instead of a fork. It was written by **[CollectingW](https://github.com/CollectingW)** (pull request #1 of `nx-mod/diablo-3`) and is merged here with the comments and log strings translated to English and a few lines of glue to fit our friend lookup. Every CTR-specific path is gated on the title the client announces; title 5745 (Diablo III) behaves as before.

What it adds, from the pull request:

- **Login.** The ticket carries the title the client announced instead of always 5745. For 5775 the online id is the player's stable Nextendo PID, which CTR needs to tie a game to its host. `extra_data` carries both `nso_subscription_status` and `extended_data`.
- **Signed auth replies.** CTR checks an `X-Signature` header before it reads the ticket, so an unsigned reply cannot log in. Set `CTR_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` to the path of an RSA-2048 private key (PEM, exponent 65537); `openssl` must be on the `PATH`. Replies for 5775 are signed with RSA-PSS/SHA-256, zero-length salt, each verified before it is sent. The server refuses to start if the key or `openssl` cannot produce a valid signature. The matching public key must be installed in the CTR client mod, which is not part of this repository, and no key is shipped.
- **Umbrella tokens.** `/v1.0/tokens/lsg/` answers on its own and requires an unexpired ticket this server issued.
- **Contextual sessions (service 138).** Create, update, delete, request an id and initialize, with owner checks and context separation; friend sessions (138/14) so friends show as joinable.
- **Async matchmaking (service 145).** Search validation, a queue that pairs players on matching filters and capacity, host and backend documents, and host-document sync before a guest joins.
- **Rich presence (service 68)** and the reply formats CTR's tasks need (`bdHTTPProxyResponse`, structured replies).
- `CTR_MIGRATE=1` sends the lobby migration message CTR was first tried with. Off by default: it makes the game wait for a migration and close after about 12 seconds.

The merge changed one thing for Diablo III: games whose host disconnects are now orphaned and removed when the host does not come back, instead of staying findable until the connection closes. A task the server cannot parse now gets an empty success instead of no answer.

Checked by us: this merge builds and every test passes, including CollectingW's, and Diablo III was run on the merged build on a local stack (a CFW Switch and a Citron phone logged in, season 37 was served, and a game was created and found). Not checked by us: Crash Team Racing itself, which we have never run against this server. CTR's hostnames for the hosts entries and its sni-router route have not been verified.

## Optional features

Both are off or inert until you set them up. Season rotation changes the season for every save that plays on the server, and changing the season, up or down, can damage a savegame: see [PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md#settings). Neither has been tried on a running game yet; the code and settings are covered by tests.

- **Monthly season rotation.** The season advances every month through the seasons listed in `pubfiles.json` (14 to 39; add more there) with each season's theme switched on, then starts over. Enable it with `"season_rotation": { "enabled": true }`. See [PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md#season-rotation).
- **Weekly Challenge Rifts.** Put `challengerift_config.dat` and the `challengerift_NN.dat` files from d3hack's release zip (`config/d3hack-nx/rift_data/`) in `D3_RIFTDATA` (default `riftdata/`) and the server serves one per week, looping back to the first. The files are captured game data and are not in this repository. See [PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md#challenge-rifts).

## Development notes

- Runtime state (`sessions/`, `pubfiles/`, `dumps/`) is created next to the binary and ignored by git, as is `riftdata/`.
- `D3_DUMPS=<dir>` records raw auth bodies and lobby frames; `D3_VERBOSE=1` logs every decrypted lobby message.
- For co-op between a console running d3hack and a stock peer, keep d3hack's cheat sections off and set `MaxParagonLevel = 20000`. Gameplay-changing patches on one side desync the session and the game drops the join a few seconds later. Community buffs come from this server instead.

## Known limits

What this server does not do, and what has not been checked. Read this before relying on it.

**Friends are lightly tested, and why.** Only two accounts on two devices, a CFW Switch and Citron on a local test stack, have ever been used, so there has never been a real friend graph to test against.
- Citron friends resolve by Nextendo PID and were checked in both directions between those two accounts.
- Console friends are identified by Nintendo ids, not PIDs. They resolve either from a local `baas-proxy` log (`BAASPROXY_LOG`, which exists only on a local stack) or by asking nextendo-account's `/internal/resolve`. The account lookup is covered by tests against a stand-in service only. It has never run against real friend ids, because a console's real friend list is built by nx-account, which is private.
- **The in-game "friends online" indicator does not come from this server.** It comes from Nintendo friend presence (`nn::friends`), which Nextendo supplies. This server reports who is connected to nextendo-account (`/internal/presence-batch`); the devices read presence from the account service of their deployment. On a local test stack with real Nextendo accounts the two never meet: the local account service does not know those accounts and the devices do not ask it, so no friend has ever been seen shown as online, on either device. The server's answer to the friend lookup was checked in the log (the game was told the friend was online) and the game still showed nobody. Checking the indicator needs a deployment where the account service that receives this server's report is the one the devices ask.
- Friend status (rich presence) uses CollectingW's `ctr_presence.go`, whose layout matches what Diablo III sends in our logs. It looks a friend up by the raw id the game asks about, so it matches a Citron PID but not yet a console's Nintendo id. It has not been seen working in a live Diablo III game.

**Empty services (being framed on the `testing` branch).** The game asks for leaderboards and stats, hero upload, mail, counters and event logging. `main` answered each with nothing. The `testing` branch now **stores** these — scores per leaderboard (shaped after Blizzard's own Diablo III Game Data API and served on the dashboard's `/api/leaderboards`), uploaded hero blobs, counters and mail — and frames a reply for each. The typed reply for the tasks whose Switch wire layout is not captured yet is off by default (`D3_FRAMED_REPLIES=1` turns it on for a capture session); until then the game still sees empty leaderboards, but nothing is lost. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

**Persistence (`testing` branch).** User data, hero uploads, counters, mail and leaderboards are kept on disk under `D3_STATE` (default `state/`, `off` for memory only) and survive a restart. Public games stay in memory by design.

**Matchmaking.** On the `testing` branch, abandoned games expire (`D3_SESSION_TTL`, default 900 s) and full games are hidden from search, so a stale or full game is no longer handed to a joiner. Search filters are still ignored (the per-attribute format is not captured) and play is peer to peer only.

**Security.** `NEXTENDO_REQUIRE_TICKET=1` (`testing` branch) refuses the all-zero handshake key, so a client with no ticket cannot log in unidentified; it is off by default for older tickets. There is no rate limiting (the client re-authenticates in a loop, so a naive per-IP limit would block legitimate reconnects) or moderation beyond the account gate (`NEXTENDO_REQUIRE_ACCOUNT`).

**Seasons.** Only season 37 is tested, on game builds 2.7.6 and 2.7.7. Changing the served season, up or down, can damage a savegame (see [PUBFILES.md](PUBFILES.md#settings)). Season rotation and Challenge Rifts have not been tried on a running game.

**Unknowns.** Whether the game reads `Config.txt` keys beyond the ones sent, what the blacklist's `0` and `1` mean, and the request and reply formats of the empty services.

## To do

- Leaderboards, stats and hero storage: storage and the Blizzard-API-shaped model are framed on the `testing` branch; capture the bdStats/bdStorage request and reply layouts from a live session, then enable `D3_FRAMED_REPLIES` and adjust the row writers to finish them end-to-end.
- Persist public games and friend status (user data, hero files, counters, mail and leaderboards are persisted on the `testing` branch).
- Honor the search filters (stale/full games are already skipped on the `testing` branch; the per-attribute filter format still needs a capture). Add rate limits carefully (the client reconnects in a loop).
- Stable per-account Demonware user id in the Diablo III ticket: the ticket still carries user id 1 at +17 (CTR already uses the PID). Needs on-device testing before changing the tested login path — see NOTES.md.
- Check console friends, friend status and the "friends online" indicator against real accounts on a real deployment (rich presence now resolves console friend ids on the `testing` branch, still unconfirmed live).
- Try Challenge Rifts and season rotation on a running game.
- Translate the French comments and log strings left in `ctr_*.go` and `lobbydoc.go`.
- Let rich presence resolve a console friend id to a PID, as friend lookups already do (`onlinePlayerFor`).
- Run Diablo III and Crash Team Racing on the merged server and confirm neither changed.
- Find the `Config.txt` keys the game reads, and the meaning of the blacklist values.

Everything specific to Diablo III (ticket layout, lobby handshake and crypto, task reply format, the service/task map) was reverse-engineered from the game binary; the addresses and layouts are documented in the source comments.

Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled (title 5775): the server code for it is **[CollectingW](https://github.com/CollectingW)**'s, from the [`crash-team-racing` branch of CollectingW/diablo-3](https://github.com/CollectingW/diablo-3/tree/crash-team-racing) (pull request #1 of `nx-mod/diablo-3`). It is merged here as sent, with English comments and log strings only where the merge touched them; the French left in `ctr_*.go` and `lobbydoc.go` is theirs and still to translate. The reverse engineering of CTR's Demonware behaviour is theirs.
